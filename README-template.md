## Overview

I just started this challenge.

This is a new challenge for HTML and CSS on frontend mentor.

My plan is to finish this and then move back to learning JavaScript better.

This way I can keep my HTML and CSS skills sharp while I am "taking a break" from learning JavaScript.

I will still be coding and working on something even though I am "taking a break".

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process
======================================
FIRST
======================================
After downloading the files from frontend mentor's website, I opened this README page to update it to reflect my process as I go. I have been trying to be better at keeping better documentation of my process. I have also been trying to keep notes in my code to help explain what I am doing and my thought process.

======================================
SECOND
======================================
I set my files up. I open the style-guide to help set up the colors, font families, font sizes and weights, and import those to the stylesheet. I also open the mobile and desktop preview images along with the active states image. This way I can start to plan my approach.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development


Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.



### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is my first go to when I can't remember how to do something that I have done before or I need to reference syntax etc.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
